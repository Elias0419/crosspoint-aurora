## 🌅 Aurora — a personal fork

> You are looking at the **`aurora`** branch of [jetaudio/crosspoint-aurora](https://github.com/jetaudio/crosspoint-aurora), a personal fork of
> [crosspoint-reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader). It adds a **LilyGo T5 S3 Pro / Pro Lite** target, a
> touch-first UI, fully configurable buttons, and complete **Vietnamese** support. `master` here mirrors upstream untouched — every
> change below lives on `aurora`, and firmware updates come from this repository's releases, not upstream's.

### Everything this fork adds over upstream

**New hardware target**

- **LilyGo T5 S3 Pro / Pro Lite** (`pio run -e lilygo`) — ESP32-S3 driving the 4.7" 960×540 16-gray panel over the S3's i80 LCD
  peripheral (no on-glass controller), with GT911 touch, PCF8563 RTC, BQ27220 fuel gauge + BQ25896 charger, the frontlight on
  GPIO11, and the PCA9535 expander key on the case (IO48). Brought up and verified on real hardware.
- **Serial debug harness** — `scripts/serial_screen_capture.py` pulls the framebuffer as a PNG and injects key presses, taps,
  long-presses and swipes over USB serial, so the UI can be exercised and diffed without touching the device.

**Touch-first UI**

- **Control Center** — an iOS-style sheet pulled from the top edge (or a status-bar tap): brightness slider with real **−/+**
  buttons, a lamp on/off button, **1% steps** with 1% as the floor, plus quick tiles for night mode, ghost-cleanup refresh,
  reading orientation, the touch kill-switch, a screenshot, and sleep. **Which tiles it shows is a setting** (Settings → Display →
  Customise Control Center); the frontlight row always stays.
- **Touch kill-switch** — turn the digitiser off for reading with a palm on the glass, from a tile or a key.
- **Full touch routing for the Aurora chrome** — taps, drags and swipes across home, settings, the reader and every popup.
- **Pure 1-bit chrome** — the tab bar, option popups and control center drop their dithered-gray washes for solid/outlined shapes,
  which is what an e-ink panel actually renders cleanly.

**Configurable buttons**

- **Every key gets its own tap and hold action**, chosen from one shared list: nothing, next/previous page, back, home, reader
  menu, control center, night mode, refresh, frontlight, touch on/off, sleep. Covers the capacitive **Home** key, the **IO48**
  expander key (which previously did nothing useful) and **BOOT**.
- Two-zone navigation for button-only devices, plus a three-way **button hints** setting (off / front only / front + edge).

**Vietnamese**

- Complete **Vietnamese UI translation**, and **UI fonts regenerated from Noto Sans** so every diacritic is covered.
- Selectable **system font**: Noto Sans or Ubuntu (Vietnamese).
- **NFC normalisation** of EPUB text, so books stored as NFD still render their tone marks correctly.

**Reader and typography**

- **Drop caps** — an enlarged decorative initial on chapter openings, with **selectable drop-cap faces** loaded from the SD card.
- **Small caps** — the opening line of a chapter set in all-caps.
- **Redesigned reader** — clean page plus an overlay toolbar (Contents / Text / More), font changes applied in place with no book
  reopen, hold-to-jump in the panel lists, and overlays that open on a HALF refresh so no gray ghost is left behind.
- **Aurora home screen** — slim status bar, a "Continue Reading" hero card with cover and progress, card-style recent books, and a
  persistent bottom icon tab bar. Night mode inverts the whole UI, not just the page.

**Library and system**

- **File browser context menu** (long-press): rename and delete.
- **~300 KB of flash reclaimed** by compiling hyphenation only for the languages actually shipped (en/fr/es/it).
- **Fast wake** — boot no longer blocks waiting for the power button to be released, so the UI draws immediately.
- **OTA from this fork** — update checks read this repository's releases (asset `firmware-lilygo.bin` for the T5 S3, `firmware.bin`
  for the C3 X4/X3), so an update never overwrites Aurora with stock CrossPoint.

> 📌 The Vietnamese translation and fonts have been contributed back upstream. The rest (Aurora theme, touch UI, configurable
> buttons, LilyGo target, drop caps) continues to live on this branch.

## USB-locked devices (Xteink Unlocker)

Some Xteink units purchased from third-party stores (e.g. AliExpress) ship with USB flashing locked from the factory.
If your device is locked, you will need to use the **Xteink Unlocker** tool available at
https://crosspointreader.com/#unlock-tool before you can flash CrossPoint.

**You do not need this tool if you bought your device directly from xteink.com.** Those units are not locked.

**Not sure if your device is locked?** Power it on, connect the USB-C cable, and try flashing via the web flasher first (see
[Install firmware](#install-firmware) below). If the browser's serial device picker does not show your device, try a different
USB port or browser before assuming the device is locked. Only reach for the unlocker if the device still doesn't appear.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THE UNLOCKER ⚠️
> 
> **The only officially supported firmwares in the unlock tool are CrossPoint and CrossInk.**
> 
> Flashing any other firmware on a USB-locked device may **permanently brick the device** or leave it **permanently
> stuck on that firmware with no recovery path**. Once USB flashing is re-locked, your only way back is via OTA, and if
> the firmware you flashed doesn't support OTA, **there is no way out**.

## Install firmware

### Web installer (recommended)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), and choose an official CrossPoint release.

### Web installer (specific version)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Download a `firmware.bin` from [Releases](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases), local build, or continuous integration artifact.
3. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), click "Custom .bin" and upload a `firmware.bin`.

### Revert to Official Firmware

To revert to the official firmware, you can also flash the latest official firmware using https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools.

### Command line

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):

```bash
pip install esptool
```

2. Download `firmware.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases).
3. Connect your device via USB-C.
4. Find the device port. On Linux, run `dmesg` after connecting. On macOS:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit"' --info
```

5. Flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```

Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` to match your system.

### Manual

See [Development quick start](#development-quick-start) below.

## Custom SD-card fonts

Convert your own TTF/OTF files into `.cpfont` files that load from the SD card. No firmware reflash is needed.

1. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/fonts and open the "SD-card font builder" form.
2. Upload up to four styles (regular, bold, italic, bold-italic), set the family name, point sizes, and Unicode range.
3. Download the generated `.cpfont` files.
4. Copy them to your SD card under `/fonts/YourFont/` (or `/.fonts/YourFont/` to hide the folder).
5. Select the font on the device from the font settings.

Conversion runs the firmware repo's `lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py` script unmodified, so output matches a local host build.

---

## Development quick start

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/pioarduino) or VS Code + pioarduino plugin
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader
cd crosspoint-reader

# if cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Contributor pre-PR checks

```bash
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check -e default
pio run -e default
```

### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

After that run the script:

```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```

Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based on this constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:

```text
.crosspoint/
├── epub_<hash>/         # one directory per book, named by content hash
│   ├── progress.bin     # reading position (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # generated cover image
│   ├── book.bin         # metadata: title, author, spine, TOC
│   ├── css_rules.cache  # parsed CSS rule cache
│   ├── img_*            # rendered image cache files
│   └── sections/        # per-chapter layout cache
│       ├── 0.bin
│       ├── 1.bin
│       └── ...
├── settings.json        # device settings
├── state.json           # resume/runtime state
└── recent.json          # recent books list
```

Removing `/.crosspoint` clears all cached metadata and forces a full regeneration on next open. Book deletes, overwrites, and moves done through the firmware or web UI clear or re-key matching caches; manual SD-card edits may leave stale cache directories behind.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).

## Community forks

One of the best things about open source is that anyone can take the code in a different direction. If you need something outside CrossPoint's [scope](./SCOPE.md), check out the community forks:

- [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) — Typography and reading tracking: Bionic Reading (bolds word stems to create fixation points), guide dots between words, improved paragraph indents, and replaces the default fonts with ChareInk/Lexend/Bitter.

- [papyrix-reader](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-reader) — Adds FB2 and MD format support. Actively maintained with Arabic script support. Custom themes via SD card.

- ~~[crosspet](https://github.com/trilwu/crosspet) — A Vietnamese fork that adds a Tamagotchi-style virtual chicken that grows based on your reading milestones (pages read, streaks, care). Also: Flashcards, Weather, Pomodoro timer, and mini-games.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-cjk](https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk) — Purpose-built for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean reading.

- [inx](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx) — Completely reimagines the user interface with tabbed navigation.

- ~~[PlusPoint](https://github.com/ngxson/pluspoint-reader) — custom JS apps support.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-papers3](https://github.com/juicecultus/crosspoint-reader-papers3) — Crosspoint port for M5Stack Paper S3. 

- [t5s3-reader](https://github.com/ShallowGreen123/t5s3-reader) — Crosspoint port for LilyGo T5 ePaper S3 / T5S3 4.7-inch e-paper device.

**Note:** Many of these features will make their way into CrossPoint over time. We maintain a slower pace to ensure rock-solid stability and squash bugs before they reach your device.
